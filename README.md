Business Problem Overview
AllLife Bank wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors) and we need to identify the potential customers
who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan based on the data
of 5000 clients that we offered a personal loan from a previous campaign.
Solution Approach
To predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans, to understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving purchases, and identify which segment of customers to target more, we are going to pick between 3 Decision Tree Models the one that shows the highest Recall Score as we want to minimize the false negatives and miss the business opportunity. The models may differ in attributes or in size for pruning methods may be applied.
